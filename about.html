<!---		  <p style="margin:auto auto 20px auto; width:60%">Let's face it, fellow Dungeon Master: you're never going to run <em>Queen of the Spiders</em> as written. It's nine editions stale, and you'd want to customize it for your world anyway. Plus, most pre-written adventures are boring and can't hold a candle to your own imagination. You read them mostly for inspiration.</p>

		  <h3>The Story</h3>
		  <p>Two weeks ago, I (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/firthisaword/submitted/" target=_blank>/u/firthisaword</a>) posted to three RPG subreddits (
			  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/66q803/dms_of_dnd_how_do_you_find_adventures/" target=_blank>/r/DnD</a>, 
			  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/66qay7/gms_of_pathfinder_rpg_how_do_you_find_adventures/" target=_blank>/r/Pathfinder_RPG</a>, 
			  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mattcolville/comments/66q9kd/dms_colvillains_how_do_you_find_adventures/" target=_blank>/r/MattColville</a>
			  
			  ) with the following question:</p>
		  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #999">
		  <p><em>I am an RPG enthusiast and UX researcher trying to understand how GMs find adventures, encounters, and maps suitable to their game. Please take a few minutes to help me design a better adventure database for you.</em></p>
		  <p>
Your players stepped off your map/railroad at the end of your last session and you need to prepare some content for them for next week.</p>
<ul><li>Where do you look for adventures or encounters to include?</li>
<li>What are the most important things you want to know about a new adventure to determine if it'll be appropriate?</li>
<li>How do you get this information about a new adventure now?</li></ul>
		  </div>
		  <br/>
		  	<p>Your answers were detailed and informative, leading me to these major conclusions:</p>

<h5>1. DMs homebrew everything</h5>
<p>Most DMs who responded did not use pre-written adventures <strong>at all</strong>, relying instead on their own creativity. Anything they found or used was heavily reworked to adapt to their players and campaigns.</p>

<h5>2. Searching is quick and dirty</h5>
<p>DMs in need of a map, encounter, plot point, or anything else to throw in front of their players used a shotgun approach, looking anywhere they could think of for something they could work with: Google Images, Pinterest, RPG subreddits and forums, random content generators, etc. To find something of value in a pre-written adventure, they have to have seen it and saved it previously, otherwise it'd just take too long.</p>

<h5>3. Finding content is easier than saving it</h5>
<p>DMs had read tons of pre-written adventures and had even saved some for later, but they usually couldn't save any context or metadata with them. Returning to their PDF folder a few months later, they had no idea what sparked their interest about each particular adventure.</p>

<h5>4. Anything can inspire</h5>
<p>DMs derive inspiration from any media they could find: movies, books, drawings, etc. They often flipped through old adventure books or Dungeon magazines just looking for cool, memorable stuff to steal.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>In light of these conclusions, I propose a system that:</p>
</div>
		  			<table class="u-half-width" style="margin:auto; width:60%">
		  				
		  			  <thead>
		  			  </thead>
		  			  <tbody>
		  			    <tr><td><i class="fa fa-shield"></i>   Is focused on serendipitous browsing, not rigorous search</td></tr>
						<tr><td><i class="fa fa-shield"></i>   Lets users browse not only whole adventures, but individual plot hooks, people, and places</td></tr>
						<tr><td><i class="fa fa-shield"></i>   Offers archiving and annotation capabilities so that when DMs discover cool content, they can store and organize it</td></tr>
						<tr><td><i class="fa fa-shield"></i>   Lets users see collections of content created by other users, and share theirs in turn</td></tr>
		  			  </tbody>
