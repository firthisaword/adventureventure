			notes: "Kalarel the Vile is my favorite low level bad guy. Introduce him as soon as you can, and let the players encounter him while they're still too low level to defeat him. Then, let them work their way up to his keep. I stole the idea of a necromancer stealing bodies from the Black Company books, and the cursed gold with which Kalarel pays for bodies from the Belgariad."

			notes: "Great starting town, but there's no good reason for PCs to go to the moat house except it's there. Too many high-level NPCs in the village, perhaps it's worth adjusting that. If you're feeling bold, replace the moat house dungeon with the one from Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil."
