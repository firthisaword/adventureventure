An orc assault burns the temple of Freya and steals a holy item, the Crucible of Freya. The adventurers must track the orc raiders back to their lair in the old keep and regain the item. The twisted shadow of Eralion, a failed lich, lurks deep in the earth beneath the keep. The PCs can either defeat or save Eralion and gain his treasure, assuming they discover his presence.</p>

					<p>The Village of Hommlet has grown up around a crossroads in a woodland. Once far from any important activity, it became embroiled in the struggle between gods and demons when the Temple of Elemental Evil arose but a few leagues away. Luckily of its inhabitants, the Temple and its evil hordes were destroyed a decade ago, but Hommlet still suffers from incursions of bandits and strange monsters. </p>

			<p><strong>Campaign Notes:</strong><em> Great starting town, but there's no good reason for PCs to go to the moat house except it's there. Too many high-level NPCs in the village, perhaps it's worth adjusting that. If you're feeling bold, replace the moat house dungeon with the one from Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil.</em></p>

			<p>Kobold raiders are menacing the Nentir Vale village of Winterhaven. They attack the player characters who are also traveling to Winterhaven. When the player characters arrive at Winterhaven, they are asked to clean out the kobold nest. The player characters soon discover that the kobolds are pawns of Kalarel, a priest of Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath. Kalarel has a lair at a nearby ruined keep that contains the Shadow Rift, once a gateway to the Shadowfell and is no longer in use. Kalarel plans to reopen the Shadow Rift to connect the material world to Orcus's temple in the Shadowfell. This unleashes an army of undead upon the unsuspecting region. The player characters journey to the keep and descend through its crypts, resulting in a final climactic confrontation with Kalarel.</p>

Introduce him as soon as you can, and let the players encounter him while they're still too low level to defeat him. Then, let them work their way up to his keep. I stole the idea of a necromancer stealing bodies from the Black Company books, and the cursed gold with which Kalarel pays for bodies from the Belgariad.</em></p>

			<p>Years ago, brave heroes put the denizens of the Temple of Elemental Evil to the sword. Now, dark forces whisper again in the shadows of the once-deserted temple - forces far more insidious and dangerous than any sane person could dream. Evil has risen again to threaten the village of Hommlet. Characters battle the power of darkness in Hommlet and beyond, forging their way through hundreds of dire encounters before reaching the fiery finale. Designed as the backbone of a full campaign, Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil takes characters from 4th to as high as 14th level. This deluxe adventure builds on the groundwork of the original Temple of Elemental Evil (1985), as well as other classic adventures. However, none of those products are necessary to enjoy this one.</p>
